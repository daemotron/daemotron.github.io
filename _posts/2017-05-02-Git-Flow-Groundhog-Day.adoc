Yes, this is all over again the old discussion about what's the best branching
model for projects using https://git-scm.com/[Git] as their version control
system. I know, there are countless blog posts about that topic out there...
yet, I feel most of the discussion is focused on projects with continuous
deployment (i. e. mostly web applications), whereas classical desktop software
with classical release cycles are rather underrepresented.

First, some thoughts on what I actually need, before creating any new ideas
others put already in the bin due to being unfit... When hacking on a desktop
software or an operating system (i. e. something that will be deployed on
many systems, by many people, without me as developer being aware), it all
comes down to releases. People are used to releases, updates etc. being clearly
labelled with a http://semver.org/[semantic version] designator.
