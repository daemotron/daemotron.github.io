Time to change things. While originally this site was set up to run with HubPress, it never really worked up for as well as it promised in the beginning. Working with HubPress was hit and miss &amp;mdash; for me it frequently lost its session context, losing some work done. Also it was pretty picky which browser it worked with.</description></item><item><title>Reboot</title><link>https://daemotron.github.io/2017/04/30/reboot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daemotron.github.io/2017/04/30/reboot/</guid><description>I amar prestar aen,
