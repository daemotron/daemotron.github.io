Nearly every X-Plane plugin accesses one or several of X-Plane's [datarefs](https://developer.x-plane.com/datarefs/) at runtime. It's not uncommon to find code like this:

```c
void set_data(float value)
{
    XPLMDataRef dref = XPLMFindDataRef("what/ever/data/ref/we/need");
    XPLMSetDataf(dref, value);
}
```

Admittedly this works. However, there are a couple of reasons why the code above is not the best idea, if you're seeking to write a solid and well-performing plugin:

* The code doesn't check if dref actually points to a dataref before attempting to write to it
* The caller doesn't get notified about success or failure of the operation
* `XPLMFindDataRef` is expensive, and should be used only during plugin initialisation

In fact, also [X-Plane's SDK documentation](https://developer.x-plane.com/sdk/XPLMDataAccess/) emphasizes the third point:

> The task of looking up a data reference is relatively expensive; look up your data references once based on the verbose path strings, and save the opaque data reference value for the duration of your pluginâ€™s operation. Reading and writing data references is relatively fast (the cost is equivalent to two function calls through function pointers).

I tend to organise the code to handle all dataref operations in a dedicated source code file with a fitting header file. In my nomenclature they're called `data.c` and `data.h` in most of my projects.

Some plugins only require to handle very few datarefs; in such a case, we can write pretty explicit code:

```c
#include <math.h>

static XPLMDataRef Dref = NULL;
static int Initialized = 0;

int init_data(void)
{
    Dref = XPLMFindDataRef("what/ever/data/ref/we/need");
    if (Dref == NULL || !XPLMIsDataRefGood(Dref))
    {
        return 0;
    }
    Initialized = 1;
    return 1;
}

int set_data(float value)
{
    if (Initialized && XPLMCanWriteDataRef(Dref))
    {
        XPLMSetDataf(Dref, value);
        return fabs(XPLMGetDataf(Dref) - value) < 0.001;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code looks a lot more complicated, but it addresses the shortcomings of our previous example:

* `init_data` is called from `XPluginStart` or `XPluginEnable`, so the expensive `XPLMFindDataRef` is only called once
* `init_data` checks whether the initialisation was successfull, and returns `1` if true, otherwise `0`
* `set_data` uses the cached reference of the dataref, instead of using its own lookup every time it's called
* `set_data` checks whether it's safe to attempt writing to the dataref
* `set_data` checks if the write operation was successful (i.e. the value of the dataref and the submitted parameter are similar)

In case you wonder about the somewhat funky comparison in `set_data`'s return value: this is called an epsilon comparison ([comparing two floats for equality is a bad idea](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition/)). I admit it's not the most clever implementation, but it will do for our purpose (while an equality comparison could actually trigger a false negative result). Depending the actual purpose and values expected, it might become necessary to implement and [ULP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_in_the_last_place)-based comparison.

While this approach is pretty effective for a small number of datarefs, it just bloats with an increasing number of datarefs. There are ways to work with these, but that's for another post -- hopefully somewhere soon.
