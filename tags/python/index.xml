Python&amp;rsquo;s built-in exceptions cover a whole host of cases. However, some problems might be library-specific and deserve a custom exception.
Custom ExceptionsCreating a custom exception in Python isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly hard when observing a few rules:
Custom exceptions shall be derived from Python&amp;rsquo;s Exception class By convention, exception names shall end with &amp;ldquo;Error&amp;rdquo; 1class MyLibError(Exception): 2 pass In many library packages, you will find exceptions similar to the one shown in the code example above.</description></item><item><title>Colours in Django Models</title><link>https://daemotron.github.io/2017/11/08/colours-in-django-models/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daemotron.github.io/2017/11/08/colours-in-django-models/</guid><description>Colours are quite a common property to real world objects. So naturally when building web applications, sooner or later one encounters the need to assign a colour attribute to an object. For Django developers, this usually means adding a models.CharField to their model, ready to capture the colour&amp;rsquo;s hex code.
Technically this works pretty well, as those hex codes can directly be used in HTML style attributes, embedded SVG drawings, etc.</description></item><item><title>Pythonic Distance Conversion</title><link>https://daemotron.github.io/2017/05/28/pythonic-distance-conversion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://daemotron.github.io/2017/05/28/pythonic-distance-conversion/</guid><description>When dealing with distances or lengths, it&amp;rsquo;s a common problem to convert values between all the different units available out there. Of course, converting itself is a less than complicated simple floating point division or multiplication, depending on how values and conversion factors are stored internally. However, maintaining conversion factors all across a project is a tedious task, and Python has some good means at hand to simplify our life.</description></item></channel></rss>
