Time to change things. While originally this site was set up to run with &lt;a href="https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io">HubPress&lt;/a>, it never really worked up for as well as it promised in the beginning. Working with HubPress was hit and miss &amp;mdash; for me it frequently lost its session context, losing some work done. Also it was pretty picky which browser it worked with. And finally, in 2019, HubPress got shut down. The GitHub repo is still around (archived, i.e. read-only), so there&amp;rsquo;s no hope the pending issues will ever see a fix.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reboot</title><link>https://www.my-universe.com/2017/04/30/reboot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.my-universe.com/2017/04/30/reboot/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>And again, my world is changing. A bit more than one year ago, I moved from a self-hosted blog built with &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost&lt;/a> to a fully managed website using Jimdo&amp;rsquo;s website construction kit. Sure, the effort for maintaining the full stack (server, os, database, web server software, etc.) has gone, and I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t want it back.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
